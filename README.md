1)First import the data
2)After that I looked for Nan values in the Data and made the Data Visualization
3)From Data Visualization charts it is seen that the target veriable is mostly dependent on 'X1', 'X3', 'X5', 'X6', 'X7', 'X8', 'X9',
'X11','X15', 'X16', 'X17', 'X18', 'X19','X20', 'X21', 'X22', 'X23', 'X24', 'X25', 'X52', 'X53', 'X56', 'X57' features.
4)For Implementing Machine Learning Models I used following algorithms:
  i) Logistic Regression
  ii) Random Forest
  iii) Linear SVC
  iv) Decision Tree
  v) Neural Network
5)From evalution matrix it is evident that random forest gives the best performance.
So I used the random forest for the prediction of the test data.
