First import the data
After that I looked for Nan values in the Data and made the Data Visualization
From Data Visualization charts it is seen that the target veriable is mostly dependent on 'X1', 'X3', 'X5', 'X6', 'X7', 'X8', 'X9',
'X11','X15', 'X16', 'X17', 'X18', 'X19','X20', 'X21', 'X22', 'X23', 'X24', 'X25', 'X52', 'X53', 'X56', 'X57' features.
For Implementing Machine Learning Models I used following algorithms:
  1) Logistic Regression
  2) Random Forest
  3) Linear SVC
  4) Decision Tree
  5) Neural Network
From evalution matrix it is evident that random forest gives the best performance.
So I used the random forest for the prediction of the test data.
